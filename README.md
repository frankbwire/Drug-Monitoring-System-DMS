# Drug-Monitoring-System-DMS
* Drug Monitoring System with Notification
# ABSTRACT

The Pharmacy/Chemist Drug Monitoring System is a system that helps pharmacy and chemists
not to sell expiry drugs to the local mwananchi who has little or no knowledge concerning drugs
and its expiry. The PCDMS allows health experts in pharmacies and chemists to classify drugs in
order and be able to get an alert when drugs are almost expiring or have expired. It aims at also
reducing wastage of resource and wastage of money used to acquire drugs.
The PCDMS will also help to evaluate the amount of drugs required in a pharmacy or chemist
per a particular time so as to reduce acquiring more than needed drugs that will likely take long
and expire before consumption. It will also aim at classify those types of drugs that expire faster
than the others so that they can be sold fast or rather so that they do not bring in a large number
of supply that will end up going to waste.
